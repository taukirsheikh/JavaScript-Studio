Pattern: "^(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[^\w\d\s]).{8,}$"


The` .` matches any character except line terminators, and the * matches zero or more of the preceding character (in this case, .). The absence of a `?` after the `* `makes the quantifier greedy, meaning that it matches as many characters as possible while still allowing the regular expression to match.

So, `.*` will match the largest possible number of characters that allows the rest of the regular expression pattern to match.


| Keyword | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| `^` | This is a start-of-line anchor. It signifies that the following pattern should start at the beginning of the line. |
| `(?=.*\d)` | This is a positive lookahead assertion. It checks that the following pattern (in this case, `.*\d`) matches the input string without actually consuming any characters. The `.*` means any character (except newline) zero or more times, and the `\d` matches any digit. So this assertion checks that the input string contains at least one digit. |
| `(?=.*[a-z])` | This is another positive lookahead assertion, similar to the previous one. It checks that the input string contains at least one lowercase letter. |
| `(?=.*[A-Z])` | This is also a positive lookahead assertion, checking that the input string contains at least one uppercase letter. |
| `(?=.*[^\w\d\s])` | This is the last positive lookahead assertion in the pattern. It checks that the input string contains at least one special character. The `[^...]` syntax matches any character that is not in the given set, and `\w` and `\d` match word characters and digits, respectively. So `[\w\d]` matches any word character or digit, and `[^[\w\d]\s]` matches any non-word character that is not whitespace. |
| `.{8,}` | This is a pattern that matches any character (except newline) eight or more times. The `.` matches any character, and the `{8,}` means eight or more times. This pattern requires that the input string be at least 8 characters long. |
| `$` | This is an end-of-line anchor. It signifies that the previous pattern should match the end of the line. |

Overall, this regular expression pattern requires that a password contain at least one digit, one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one special character, and be at least 8 characters long. It is a commonly used pattern for password validation.




    `(?=.*\d)`: This is a positive lookahead assertion that checks if the string contains at least one digit `(\d)`. The` .* `means match any character (except for line terminators \n , \t) zero or more times before the digit. The `(?= )` is a lookahead assertion that means "assert that the pattern inside the parentheses matches at this position, but don't include it in the overall match".
    `(?=.*[a-z])`: This is another positive lookahead assertion that checks if the string contains at least one lowercase letter ([a-z]). The .* means match any character (except for line terminators) zero or more times before the lowercase letter. The (?= ) is a lookahead assertion that means "assert that the pattern inside the parentheses matches at this position, but don't include it in the overall match".
    `(?=.*[A-Z])`: This is a third positive lookahead assertion that checks if the string contains at least one uppercase letter ([A-Z]). The .* means match any character (except for line terminators) zero or more times before the uppercase letter. The (?= ) is a lookahead assertion that means "assert that the pattern inside the parentheses matches at this position, but don't include it in the overall match".
    `.{8,}`: This matches any character (except for line terminators) at least 8 times. The . means match any character (except for line terminators). The {8,} means match the previous pattern (in this case, .) at least 8 times.
